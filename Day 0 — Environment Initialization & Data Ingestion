Day 0 was dedicated to establishing the core data engineering infrastructure and validating end-to-end dataset ingestion within the Databricks environment. The focus was on building a secure, scalable, and production-aligned analytics foundation.

Implementation Summary:

Provisioned Databricks workspace and initialized compute resources for distributed processing

Configured Kaggle API authentication to enable automated dataset acquisition

Ingested large-scale e-commerce transaction datasets (2019-Oct.csv, 2019-Nov.csv) from Kaggle

Uploaded raw data assets into DBFS to support fault-tolerant distributed storage

Loaded datasets into Spark DataFrames with schema inference enabled

Performed structural validation by confirming nine standardized attributes

Executed baseline Spark SQL queries to validate data integrity and ingestion accuracy
